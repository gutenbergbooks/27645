<div class="hd2"><h2>By HENRY HASSE</h2>

<div class="hd3"><b>Illustrated by FINLAY</b></div></div></div>

<div class="hd4"><p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the purely cerebral sense,
there was no particular point-of-sequence
at which Gral could
have been said to Know. The
very causality of his existence
was a succession of brute obedience
to brute awareness, for it
was only thus that one survived.
There was the <i>danger-sense</i> on
those days when the great-toothed
cats roamed the valley,
and the males-who-will-bring remained
huddled and sullen in the
caves above the great ledge;
there was the <i>hunger-sense</i> when
provender was low, and Gor-wah
drove them out with grunts and
gibes to hunt the wild-dogs and
lizards and lesser beasts; and
not infrequently there was the
other sense, the <i>not-hunger</i>,
when the bring had been exceptional
and there was somnolence
after the gorging.</p></div>

<p>Gral could not remember when
he had experienced the latter, for
it was the dictate of Gor-wah,
the Old One, that who did not
bring did not eat&mdash;not until the
others had gorged. Gral was
small, and weakest of all the
males. Not often did he bring.
<i>Once</i> on a spurious moment he
had scaled the valley-rim, and
came out upon the huge plain
where it was rumored the little
three-toed horses roamed. And
he had seen them, he had seen
them! He pursued, armed only
with blunt shaft and a few of
the throw-stones such as Otah
used; but he was less swift than
the tiny horses, and his throw-stones
fell wide, and it was rumored
that here roamed the
long-tusked shaggy ones that
were larger than the very caves
... trembling, Gral had retraced
his way, to arrive at the
ledge and meekly await Gor-wah's
word that he could partake
of the sinews that night.</p>

<p><i>... Point of sequence. Causality
in action. An atom is dissected,
a belly rumbles in hunger,
a star blooms into brief
nova; a bird wheels in futile escape,
an ice-flow impacts, an
equation is expressed in awesome
mushrooming shape. These
are multitudinous, apocalyptic.
They are timeless and equal.
These are things whereby suns
wheel or blossom or die, a tribe
vanishes, a civilization climbs or
a world decays.</i></p>

<p>Or an earlier sun, hot and
soft-stroking against leaves. Or
a Pleistocene man, smallest of
all the males, whose supine acceptance
had devolved into laziness....</p>

<p>Gral would not have called it
laziness; his crude synapses
could not have contained the
thought, much less given it relevance.
Even later&mdash;as Gral-the-Bringer&mdash;his
only point of relevance
was to the Place where the
great thing happened.</p>

<p>The Place was a small rocky
cleft above the river, not easily
accessible.... Gral found it one
day because he dearly loved to
climb, though all to be found
here were the lizards, stringy
and without substance. But this
day he found more. It was
<i>warmth</i>, a warmth immeasurably
more satisfying than the
caves-above-the-ledge. Here for
perhaps an hour the late sun
stroked directly in, soft and containing,
setting the narrow walls
aglow with bright-brushed patterns.</p>

<p>To Gral it was an hour apart.
He gathered leaves and placed
them here, and here he paused in
the lateness of each day though
his bring was frugal and his
belly would rumble that night.
But to <i>that</i> he was accustomed,
and this was pleasurable.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was the time of the thaw.
Gral huddled in his Place and
welcomed the stroking warmth.
He was weary, his forage had
been fruitless, his throw-stones
wasted ... would he never master
them as Otah and the others?
He had confronted a wild-dog
and pinned it snarling against
rock, he had employed his shaft
and got it fairly into flesh, only
to have the beast slip off the
smooth point and escape.
Smooth points&mdash;they were useless!
Briefly, his mind groped
with that but could not sustain
it.</p>

<p>So Gral burrowed into the
leaves, his anger diminished as
he watched with drowsy delight
the sun-patterns stroking. And
his eyes must have closed, half
closed....</p>

<p>It was no snarl that brought
him back&mdash;it was a tread, soft-shod
and cautious, very close.
The snarl came an instant later,
deep-throated with anger and
meaning.</p>

<p>Another had found this Place,
this warmth, these leaves that
were fine for burrowing. Gral
came erect and stared into the
visage of Obe the Great Bear;
just six feet away he saw the
great head that swayed with deceptive
gentleness, the amber
eyes burning, the twinned mountainous
muscle of shoulders ...
and in that quick moment Gral
saw something else. Obe stood
directly astride the pointed shaft
which Gral had left too far distant.</p>

<p>Gral did not breathe. He did
not move. Only his hand crept
slowly, but already he knew his
throw-stones were gone. Once
more Obe snarled, and Gral saw
those great shoulder muscles
slide. His hand encountered the
wall, groped desperately; then
his fingers found something&mdash;a
stick, a root, some gnarled thing
that protruded....</p>

<p>In one rearing flow of motion,
Obe launched out in a mighty
reach. Gral caught part of that
sweeping blow; stunned, he
managed to gain footing, and
now both his hands were on the
protruding object. He wrenched
and the thing came free, seeming
strange and heavy in his
hands. Obe was upon him again,
the great paws ready to crush
... pure terror sent Gral stumbling
back, but it was a different
instinct that brought his arms
once up and then down in a
great arc....</p>

<p>Once only. He felt a wondrous
impact that jarred him to the
shoulders&mdash;and then it was a
miracle. Obe was no longer upon
him. Obe lay half sprawled,
roaring with rage, and from
Obe's massive head came the
crimson life-stuff!</p>

<p>Gral did not question. Avoiding
the destructive paws, he
leaped in and away, and then in,
all the while employing the thing
in his hand until Obe's life-stuff
had run its course in crimson
ruin.</p>

<hr />

<p>Acceptance came slowly, as
Gral sagged in weariness against
the wall. He could not believe
this thing! Timorously, he approached
the great carcass and
prodded with his foot. Then he
accepted.</p>

<p>Now things were happening
inside him&mdash;a great turmoil, a
throbbing within his chest. Gral
straightened; he brought his
arms quickly up and around, and
the thing-that-slew felt wondrous
in the arc. Even better
than the throw-stones! It was
like&mdash;he struggled for the meaning&mdash;like
an extension of one's
self! One threw the stone and
yet retained it!</p>

<p>But alas, it was not a stone at
all, Gral discovered. He placed
the gnarled thing in sunlight
and crouched to survey it. This
thing-that-slew was but a length
of rotting root, frozen at the end
with clay and encrusted ice. And
already the ice was shattered.</p>

<p>The sun did the rest, as Gral
watched in despair; soon there
was only soft melting mud and
a gnarled stick that would never
slay again.</p>

<p>For a long time Gral crouched
there, trying to understand.
Dimly he perceived, but his mind
would not reach. He scowled angrily
and flung the useless stick
away. There was a thing inside
him he did not like, a strange
new thing that gnawed and
nagged and brought anger again.</p>

<p>It was anger at being robbed
of a priceless thing&mdash;but the
gnawing went deeper.</p>

<p>Wearily, he rose. He began his
trek back to the great ledge, to
make announcement that his
bring this day would be Obe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Otah</span> came, and Lak and one
other, and together they
brought Obe back. No one made
remark on the slaying; it was
enough that Obe was here! And
when Gral came forward at the
gorging to take the bringer's
share, he merely took and retired,
disdaining the great show
of prowess and exaggeration
which the others used to demonstrate
their kill. But he saw that
Gor-wah, the Old One, was
pleased. Even Otah the Thrower-of-Stones
looked at him with
envy; it was not often they had
Obe the Great Bear; only twice
before had it happened, and both
times it was Otah who brought.</p>

<p>Gral gorged voluptuously that
night. This too was new to his
experience, and this he liked.
But newer still was the thing he
did not like, the thing that continued
to gnaw and nag and
would not let him sleep.</p>

<p>And next morning, with the
valley still gray and murky before
the dawn and damp with
bitter cold, Gral was gone in advance
of the others. He clambered
down to the river and
there he pursued his way&mdash;far
along toward the place where
it widened into shallows. No
thought of bringing today! Instead
he searched. He searched
the rocky shallows as the sun
came shafting, and he was still
searching later as it climbed high.</p>

<p>He found the place at last,
where the stones were plentiful
and of proper size. There he
paused; the thing was still angry
and prodding within him;
Gral could not have known that
this "thing-that-prodded" was
not anger but a churning impatience,
a burning nameless
need&mdash;that he was in very truth
a prototype, the first in the
realm of pure research!</p>

<p>But he applied it, knowing remotely
what he must do. It was
long; it was irksome; he ached
all through with the effort but
still he persisted. Until at last,
from all the stones in the shallows,
he had gathered a dozen
that pleased him.</p>

<p>These he seized eagerly. He
spread them out; he examined;
he grunted and grimaced and
paused in perplexity. It was difficult
to choose when each might
do! But he chose, weighing each
in his hand before discarding,
until finally <i>one</i> remained.</p>

<p>He grunted his pleasure,
knowing purpose now. The
vines! Again he selected carefully.
<i>Tight</i>, said the thing-that-prodded,
<i>it must be tight or you
will have only a throw-stone</i>.</p>

<p>And so began the long task of
arranging stone to shaft, as he
brought the vine round and
round again. It was crude; his
fingers were clumsy and unaccustomed;
the vine tangled and
tore, and there was no way of
fastening. But with each failure
he found new ways, until at last
it was done.</p>

<p>It was done! A thing of extended
strength and weight, at
once so wondrous that Gral
could only place it before him
and stare. He felt a pulsing at
his throat, his thoughts went
leaping. Obe the Great Bear!
Now he could bring Obe many
times! Even Otah the Thrower-of-Stones
would be in awe!</p>

<p>Gral lifted the thing of his
creation ... and just a little
way distant, his glance caught
the bole of a tree. <i>Now this will
be Obe the Great Bear</i> ... then
Gral leapt forward, arm outflung
in the arc he remembered.</p>

<p>Truly and without effort the
weight went to the mark. It
made impact that jarred him
from arm to shoulder, but this
he did not mind because his
weapon's edge brought a great
gaping wound to the weathered
bole.</p>

<p><i>... the first sound of isolate
words across a wire. The initial
shock of mushroom-shape above
an atoll. The fierce clutch of a
weighted shaft newly fashioned
... man stands always</i> <span class="smcap">FOR A
MOMENT</span> <i>in awe of what man has
wrought.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>For a moment only. And so
Gral stood stark in his moment
of awe, truly frightened as he
visioned what such a blow might
have done to Obe. But Gral was
truly man, truly prototype; for
the time of one deep breath he
felt it, then awe and fright were
gone as he exulted.</p>

<p>Once more he brought the
shaft <i>up</i> in smooth swing and
<i>down</i> in the arc....</p>

<p>Alas for Gral&mdash;alas for research.
Alas for all the effort and
application and the prodding-thing
within. It was Gral's destiny
yet to know that a mere
day's effort was only the beginning.</p>

<p>For his second mighty swing
did not reach the bole-bark. It
reached nothing but air. He felt
a sudden lightness as the stone
fled from shaft, and he was left
holding a stick trailing vines at
the end.</p>

<p>Undaunted, he tried again,
and again it happened&mdash;the
stone went plummeting. A third
time he tried, and a fourth. He
chose the more pliant vines and
strove to make them stay,
sought a new way to fasten. The
stone would not stay.</p>

<p>Gral mourned, and from the
mourning came anger and then
a bitterness that rose to blind
him. For the rest of that day he
tried&mdash;he could not have counted
the times. A factor was missing&mdash;dimly
he knew that. The sun
was dull red along the valley
when he desisted; his hands
were raw and bleeding, and seeing
that, a sound rose in his
throat like grating gravel.</p>

<p>Grimly, he buried his stone
there beneath the bole and made
his way back to the great ledge.
His share of Obe would last yet
a day or two. The thought of
food was only fleeting, because
the anger was still inside him,
larger now, demanding now ...
that thing-that-prodded.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Obe</span> was gone at last, both
Gral's share and all the rest.
Three days were gone and Gral
did not try to bring again. But
each day he went from the ledge
in advance of the others, he
went in a hunger he did not heed&mdash;to
the place of the buried
stone.</p>

<p>On the third day he thought
that Otah followed, keeping discreetly
behind; but he could not
be sure. This was not Otah's
usual direction. And later, on the
far shore across the shallows he
saw one of Kurho's tribe from
Far End. It was not often that
Kurho's people foraged this far,
and Gral could not say how long
the man must have stood there
bold and brazen. When next he
looked up, the fellow was gone.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he would have reported
this to Gor-wah, but the
incident was soon forgotten. He
continued doggedly with shaft
and stone. It was something wild
and febrile that drove him now,
and he could not have wondered
at his own incredible quixotism&mdash;he
was a million years removed
from that! But inevitably
his synapses took hold, the
neuronic links grooved, and to
Gral one thought emerged: <i>the
vines would never do</i>.</p>

<p>And so he came to know
where the missing factor lay. He
knew it dully and was helpless.</p>

<p>More than helpless, he was
hungry. It came with a great
gnawing need. On the fifth day
it was <i>Otah</i> who noticed, and
more out of contempt than pity
tossed him the remnants of a
wild-dog he had brought: the
portion was little more than
stripped bones and sinew, but
Gral accepted without question,
crawled to his place on the ledge
and partially assuaged his hunger....</p>

<p><i>The ways of discovery are
most wondrous&mdash;yet who will
dare to say they take precedence
over the wondrous ways of the
stomach? And the ways are
ironic; is it not conceivable that
the two should align in devious
fruition?</i> For Gral found answer,
not in his groping hands,
but tangled about his clumsy
feet!</p>

<hr />

<p>The sun came high and hot.
Gral emerged from his sleep-place
on the ledge, faint and
hungry but knowing he must
try yet again. He took a step, his
feet tangled, and growling deep
he reached down and tore at a
tough twining substance.</p>

<p>Sinews. Sinews stripped bare
by his own hunger, all that Otah
and others had tossed him these
past days; they were taut and
clinging now, unresilient, like
the vines of the young trees and
yet strangely unlike.</p>

<p><i>Unlike!</i> Gral stared, as his
throat went pulsing. He reached
out and touched; one had twined
about a rock, was now so fast
that his fingers could not cause
it to move. For a long time he
crouched, perplexed, growling
deep as his fingers explored. He
glanced up at the sun, and then
back, and with that glance two
things came together with searing
shock....</p>

<p>For the very first time, man&mdash;a
Pleistocene man&mdash;had made a
clear cerebral distinction of
cause and effect.</p>

<p>Gral arose. There was a
wild new urgency. Quickly he
searched and he found, across
all the great ledge, sinews from
the gorging which the sun had
not yet touched. Some among
the tribe stared with immobile
contempt, thinking Gral the
scavenger was yet hungry. But
Gral gathered quickly, and departed,
and was soon at the far
place by the great bole, where he
retrieved his stone and set feverishly
to work.</p>

<p>Indeed it was not like the
vines! It was easy now, but he
was doubly thorough; he made
his fingers be strong as he followed
the pattern he knew so
well. The sinews held, they held!
His part done at last, he went
out from the trees and placed his
shaft where the sun's hot stroke
could reach.</p>

<p>And this was perhaps hardest
of all&mdash;the waiting. Most of that
day he crouched and waited and
watched, as the sun's work was
done; that great bright orb, his
ally; he had known times when
it was beneficent and times when
it was cruel, but now in his need
Gral's thoughts were kindly.</p>

<p>Soon it became as if his own
kind thoughts and the sun's hot
strength were one. The thing-that-prodded
now was different,
now it outpoured, gracious to
meet his need. He could not have
known that this was prayer!
And so, by degree and small degree
Gral saw the sinews grasp
and tighten.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not until the sun was low, at
valley's Far End, did he dare
reach out and take his shaft and
put it to test. But already he
knew! The stone held, and it
held, and would continue to hold
after many tries. He had fashioned
a thing and it was wondrous&mdash;his
own sole possession&mdash;a
weapon beyond anything the
valley-people had dreamed of&mdash;and
it was his alone.</p>

<p>A stirring of vague alarm
made him pause. He growled
deep. The thing-that-prodded
churned in a new way, a cunning
way, and once again Gral was
prototype. This thing must be
kept secret! Not yet would he
share&mdash;not until he became
known as Gral-the-Bringer!</p>

<p><i>... he could not have known.
Could not have known that this
thing he wrought spelled at once
Beginning and End: that no
such shocking departure remains
long sole-possessed, either
shaft or fire or mushroom-shape:
that with each great
thing of man's devising comes
question and doubt and challenge
and often disaster....</i></p>

<p>Or knowing, would not have
cared.</p>

<hr />

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/002.png" width="364" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> now he was known as Gral-the-Bringer!
He went alone
each day, taking throw-stones
which he discarded in favor of
his new weapon from its place
of hiding. He brought the wild-dogs
for a time, but soon he disdained
them. Three times more
he brought Obe the Great Bear,
but would not demonstrate his
method of kill. Sometimes he
scaled the valley-rim to the great
plain, where he slew the three-toed
horses whose flesh was
sweet and different.</p>

<p>And each time at the gorging
Otah watched him&mdash;watched
sometimes sullen and brooding,
sometimes with secret knowing.</p>

<p>And then came a day when
<i>Otah</i> brought Obe the Bear.
Three times in as many days he
brought Obe, and on the third
time he brought back also the
shaft-with-stone, bearing it boldly
to make sure that Gral and
all the others saw.</p>

<p>With half snarl and half wail,
Gral leaped to seize it. Otah
might have crushed him with a
blow, but Otah waited, looking
at him fully. Gral's snarl died in
his throat. This was not the
weapon he had hidden, but another!
Otah had found and
copied.</p>

<p>"See this!" Otah grunted. "I
slew Obe with this!" And he
demonstrated to all the tribe. He
was still angry, facing Gral, but
he gave credit. "<i>Gral</i> used it
first. Gral is greatest among us!
But if Gral can use, Otah can
use&mdash;we will all use!"</p>

<p>He turned to Gor-wah the Old
One, and said in the language of
monosyllable and gesture: "We
must have Council!"</p>

<p>There was Council, and the
truth was out. Gral held back
nothing in his telling. Gor-wah
listened and nodded and grunted,
his brow furrowed and he
growled deep in his throat.</p>

<p>"A weapon of great magic,"
Gor-wah pronounced, and he
prodded with his fingers at it,
almost afraid to touch.</p>

<p>"Arh-h-h!" echoed the males.
"A weapon of great magic!"</p>

<p>"Let us have many such,"
Otah repeated with growl and
gesture. "The tribe of Gor-wah
will be greatest in all the valley!"</p>

<p>Again Gor-wah grunted, shook
his head slowly. "The tribe of
Gor-wah seeks only food and
peace. This we have. We do well
without such a weapon."</p>

<p>"Arh-h," echoed the males.
"We do well without."</p>

<p>Gral felt helpless, listening.
All attention was now upon
Otah and the Old One. "But we
will use only for food and
peace," Otah pursued sullenly.
"Such was my meaning!"</p>

<p>Gor-wah rose, trembling.
"Meaning? I will give you meaning.
Kurho's tribe at Far End!
Already they have taken the
lesser tribes. Each year they
come in bold insolence, and only
the river separates; in time they
mean to take the whole valley.
Kurho has declared it!" He
spread his hands. "Never again
will we know peace, if Kurho
learns the way of such a
weapon!"</p>

<p>There was pause, a restless
unease. And again it was Otah
who growled boldly, touching
the weapon: "Such is the reason
for many of these. Let us make
them, and none will dare to
come!"</p>

<p>"None will dare!" echoed the
Council. But there were both
those who said it strong, and
those who said in doubt.</p>

<p>Now it was plain that even
Gor-wah was in doubt. He was
old and he had known this time
would come, the time when another
took the tribe, and that
one would be Otah. But now he
stood straight and made pronouncement.
"I say no! The risk
is too great. You, Otah&mdash;and
you, Gral&mdash;you will destroy this
weapon. It must not be used
again!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Of</span> course it was never done.
Otah also knew that he must
take the tribe, and they looked
to him now. Soon Lok had the
weapon, then Mai-ak and most
of the others, as day by day Gral
instructed them in the making.
But they used with caution!
Otah reminded them always of
the Old One's words, though
none of the Far End tribe had
been seen near the river for
many days now.</p>

<p>Until Mai-ak returned from a
journey, to announce he had encountered
one of Kurho's tribe.
"We exchanged insults. I invited
him to come close," Mai-ak
explained with amusing gesture,
"but the fellow would not. He
saw my weapon! I think he
would have given all his throw-stones
to possess it!"</p>

<p>Otah was not pleased. He
would have admonished, except
that Mai-ak told a story well; besides,
Mai-ak was a great hunter.</p>

<p>But there came another such
day, and then others. First Lok
reported and then Mai-ak again.
The reports became frequent.
Kurho's men were forever near,
watching in silence this new
weapon in the hands of the Gor-wah
tribe across the river.</p>

<p>And then Mai-ak brought a
message ... there had been another
encounter, no insults this
time but rather a sullen understanding.
Kurho was aware of
the new weapon; it made his
own people uneasy and restless;
such a thing at loose in the valley
could only spell threat to all
peoples! But, if it was to be,
then what the tribe of Gor-wah
devised Kurho's tribe would also
devise. They would devise more
and better!</p>

<p>Otah listened, growled in anger.
"Kurho says this? Kurho,
who has boasted that he will
take the whole valley?" Then he
paused and considered sensibly.
"Mai-ak, take answer. You will
say that we go in peace. Say that
never do we intend to cross
the river. And say also"&mdash;Otah
paused, groping&mdash;"say also that
we shall be ready for any who
do choose to cross!"</p>

<p>The Old One nodded approval,
but no one saw; and no one saw
the dark furrow of doubt like a
shadow of doom across his face.</p>

<p>"Kurho speaks big," sneered a
young one, new in Council. "We
have heard it before, always it is
Kurho's tribe who is greatest in
every deed...." He spat in contempt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Days were gone, endless days
without incident. But the reports
came in&mdash;a mere trickle at first,
and then in great tide. Kurho's
tribe had indeed devised. Their
weapon had been observed! Dak
returned one day in high excitement,
stumbling across the ledge
from a long day's journey.</p>

<p>"Kurho has devised better!
We bring Obe the Bear, but they
have now slain the great-toothed
one. I saw it, I swear! They slew
him easily!" He gasped for
breath, then gained his feet and
gave them eloquent gesture of
what he had seen.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt.
Kurho now had a weapon much
more facile, more deadly.</p>

<p>Otah accepted grimly. Now it
was he who must prove! He
went to work at once, he and
Gral, devising a weapon to meet
the threat&mdash;more sharp-edged
and deadly, of greater length
and balance. It took days. And
days more to seek out the place
of the great-toothed ones. Not
one but <i>three</i> were slain, and it
was made certain the word
reached Kurho.</p>

<p>But now Otah knew. He knew
and was helpless. A frightful
thing had been launched and
there could be no turning; nothing
now but the constant fear,
the trap without end, the perilous
thing above all their heads
... and the waiting.</p>

<p>Kurho also waited. True, one
thing remained to temper the
distrust: sporadic communication
had been established, a
thing new and yet heavy with
pretense, which again like a serpent
at its tail spelled mutual
distrust. But it was there, begrudging,
and all the smaller
tribes knew of it too&mdash;those
scattered ones who were little
more than clans. All the peoples
of the valley watched and waited,
aware of this thing between
the two great tribes of Kurho
and Otah.</p>

<p>"It is better that we should
talk, even endlessly, than to use
such weapons tribe against
tribe!" Such was Otah's word to
those who grumbled and those
who feared, and there was much
to indicate that such was Kurho's
feeling too.</p>

<p>Indeed it appeared to be so!
For the first time, Kurho relaxed
his borders at Far End. Occasionally
the Otah tribesmen
were permitted to enter, welcomed
without suspicion&mdash;a
thing unprecedented! Similarly,
select members from the Kurho
tribe were accepted beyond the
river; they displayed certain
prowesses new to the Otah tribe,
for in many ways these were a
strange and fantastic people.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a beginning.
Word went out in secret and still
other word returned, in which
Mai-ak played a great part. And
so, after scores of days it was
done: there would be a time of
understanding; Kurho, himself,
would cross the river to go in
person among Otah's people!
When this was done, Otah would
also cross the river to observe
the things at Far End!</p>

<p>But now growlings arose
which even Otah could not contain.
Kurho should not be welcomed!
Kurho must not be
trusted! Was not this the man
who already had suppressed the
minor tribes? Had he not flaunted
his aim of one day taking the
whole valley?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kurho came. He
came in all his boast and arrogance.
The time was not festive&mdash;he
was made to feel that&mdash;but
what Kurho felt he did not show.
Extravagant point was made
that he should see all that he
wished! Across all the great
series of ledges he was taken,
both high and low and length
and breadth, to observe the
abundance and well-being and
extent of the Otah tribe.
Through all the near valley he
was shown, even to the places of
great hunting, that he might see
how the tribe of Otah prospered
in the Bringing.</p>

<p>Through it all, Kurho made a
token show of interest; he twice
lost his temper in boast against
boast, but he was more often a
blunt enigma. He saw much and
said little. Those times when he
did speak, so extravagant were
his grunt and gesture that much
was lost.</p>

<p>When Kurho departed at last
for Far End, he had implanted
a feeling of frustration and
one thing more&mdash;the disturbing
thought that not all of his own
boasts were idle!</p>

<hr />

<p>And now came the time for
Otah to cross. It was done so
quietly that not many knew he
was gone, but soon the reports
came: Otah had been received
with great clamor and curiosity
by the Kurho people, and accorded
much honor! Aside from that,
the result was much the same,
as Otah saw much and said little
and did not once lose his temper.
Kurho persisted in his boast
and claim, and it was rumored
that the two leaders had gone so
far as to discuss the weapons!</p>

<p>Rumor was true. Otah returned
from Far End and immediately
called Council, even as
Kurho was calling Council. Little
had been gained, little proven;
the perilous thing was still
there, that monstrous means of
death that might come in a moment
of temper or reprisal to
either tribe. Alas, such weapons
were not easily relinquished&mdash;and
who would be first?</p>

<p>Plainly, the way would now be
slow and heavy with suspicion,
but a method to abate such a
threat must soon be formulated.</p>

<p>On <i>that</i> Otah and Kurho were
agreed!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> the two great leaders
agreed, and were patient, and
twice more there were meetings.
So engrossed they became and
even enamored, that they were
only dimly aware&mdash;</p>

<p>Others in the valley, those
so scattered and isolate as to
be considered only clans, had
long watched and waited&mdash;and
yearned. Neither the long-shaft
weapon nor the way of making
were longer secret&mdash;so why
should they not also have?</p>

<p>Inevitably the reports trickled
in. A lone clansman had been
observed near the river, employing
one of the weapons crudely
devised but efficient. Some days
later, one from the high-plateau
was seen skulking the valley
with such a weapon. Those lone
ones, who barely subsisted in
the barren places beyond river
and cave, nor foraged afield&mdash;discreet
and fleeting at first but
with increased daring as the
days went on.</p>

<p>And so fixed were Otah and
Kurho that such reports were
tolerated. There could be no
threat here! True, the way of
the making was no longer secret.
True, such clan-people had long
been despised and neglected and
left to their own grubbing hunger&mdash;but
was it not recognized,
especially now, that the tribes of
Otah and Kurho would determine
the fate of all?</p>

<p><i>They erred&mdash;both Otah and
Kurho. Neither would determine,
nor would preponderance
of weapons determine. It was
not yet perceived that such clan-people
were not Tribe-People,
and thus could not know the
meaning of Council, nor weigh
consequence, nor realize in their
new-found cleverness that a single
arrogant act would trigger
the first and final avalanche....</i></p>

<p>It came. It came on a day
when a lone and hungry clansman
found himself a full day's
journey beyond the river; he was
not of Otah's Tribe nor any
tribe, nor did he know that the
two he faced were of Kurho's
Tribe. In the dispute over the
bring, so emboldened was he by
his weapon newly-fashioned that
he used it quick and surely.</p>

<p>He did not again look at the
two bodies! Taking up his
bring, the lone one departed
quite leisurely, without even the
good sense to flee in horror of
the consequence.</p>

<p>Consequence came. It came
soon, before the sun was scarcely
down. It came swiftly without
question or council, as word
reached Far End that two had
been slain. Throughout the night
it came in divergent attack, as
Kurho deployed a token force
near the river and sent his real
strength high to the north,
across the valley-rim and down
upon Otah's people. It was at
once attack and reprisal and
reason!</p>

<p>And for Otah it was reason!
For many weeks past, in test
and maneuver of the long-shafts
he had looked to the north. Now
couriers brought the alarm
swiftly, and within minutes his
forces were launched&mdash;fearless
ones who knew each foot of terrain
by day or night. Otah led one
contingent and Mai-ak the other,
strategy being to stem Kurho's
strength high upon the valley-rim,
deplete the enemy and then
join force to hunt down any who
sifted through.</p>

<p>It was good strategy, the only
strategy&mdash;and for a time it went
well. Within the hour Kurho's
forces were scattered, as attack
and counter-attack surged and
slashed in wild eruption of the
long-shafts. Just as eruptive
were the neuro-emotives, as each
in his primal way must have
known that <i>this</i> was the long
awaitment, <i>this</i> was the grim
finality in Kurho's boast and
Otah's boast of weapons.</p>

<p>A few sifted through, but
were quickly brought down as
Otah's drifting rear-guard deployed
to their assignments. It
became evident early that Otah's
tribe was more proficient in the
long-shafts!</p>

<p>Alas, mere proficiency would
not prevail against force of numbers.
Well within the hour Otah
knew it, knew with a raging
despair that time was not with
him, he had deployed too late
with too little. Now he knew
with consuming clarity, that despite
the lulling pretense Kurho's
boasts of strength had not
been idle boasts!</p>

<p>This was Otah's last bitter
thought, and then he was too occupied
for cerebral indulgence.
For the next minutes he wielded
truer than any! Men came and
fell, and others leaped and fell,
skulls shattered, the life-stuff
spurting, before Otah's shaft
went spinning away in shattered
ruin; he leaped to seize another,
employed it in great
sweeping swaths against those
who still came. Two went down,
but two came to fill the gap. In
perfect unison, one parried as
the other wielded truly to the
mark....</p>

<p>It cannot be said, with surety,
that Otah in that ultimate moment
felt pain. It is fairly certain
that both finitely and cosmically
the initial numbing
shock did register; and it may be
assumed that he jolted rather
horribly at the splintering bite
of bone into brain. <i>But who can
say he did not reach a point-of-prescience,
that his neuro-thalamics
did not leap to span the
eons, and gape in horror, in that
precise and endless time just before
his brains spewed in a gush
of gray and gore, to cerebrate no
more?</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;matter</span> of minutes, now.
Both Kurho and Mai-ak
knew it. The latter had glimpsed
Otah's destruction, and with
wild abandon sought to rally his
men into the area.</p>

<p>There was no longer an area.
There was clash and groan and
rush and retreat, there was dark
endless rock and a darker sky,
from which the very stars
seemed to recoil in darkest wonderment
at man's senseless assault.
The valley-rim yawned,
and there Mai-ak made his stand
and made it well.</p>

<p>He was unaware that Kurho
was no more&mdash;that the man of
boast was at this very moment
a quivering, protoplasmic lump
splattered across a dark crevice.
A random weapon in a frantic
hand had proved to be no respecter
of person. Nor did it
matter! Decimated as they were,
enough of the enemy got
through. Once propelled in the
insane purpose there could be no
stopping, as they descended upon
Otah's people who huddled in
the caves....</p>

<p>For weeks, they had been told
that when it came it would be
from above, sudden and savage
without defense or recourse.
Few had believed, or bothered to
plot the route to safety. Would
not these issues be resolved?
Had not their caves been always
safe and secure?</p>

<p>Now there was no time for belief
or wonder. Within minutes
none of Otah's tribe were alive,
neither women nor children.
Gor-wah the Old One remained,
having failed in his exhortations;
now he stood quite still,
erect and waiting, with arms
outflung as the weapons came
swarming, and when that final
blow fell the expression upon his
mouth might have been a grimace
or might have been a
smile....</p>

<p>Nor did the others escape,
those at Far End who also huddled
and waited and would not
believe. Their caves at the valley-floor
were even less secure.
Whether it was blinding hate or
the bitter dregs of expediency,
for Mai-ak and his remnants
there was only one recourse now.
It had been deeply ingrained!</p>

<p>Grimly they pursued the way,
automaton-like, unresponsive
now to horror or any emotive.
And once again, within the hour
the weapons fell.</p>

<p>It was swift and it was thorough.</p>

<p>Methodical. Merciless. Complete.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> will not be said here when
emotive-response returned.
Does one return from a horror
all-encompassing, or seek to
requite the unrequited? Does
one yearn for a Way that is no
more when deadening shock has
wiped it out?</p>

<p>The season of thaw came, and
again the great cold and once
more the thaw. Both Obe the
Bear and the great saber-cats
were at large across the valley,
and for those few who remained
the bring was not easy now.
There was more dangerous prey!</p>

<p>Lone clansman encountered
clansman across his path, and
there was furtive slinking. Each
went silently alone and returned
alone to his place of hiding. Bellies
growled, but none dared use
his weapon except in secret.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few, some isolate
few remembered that time of
chaos a season ago&mdash;but it was
fleeting recall at best, as somatic
responses rose to blot it out.</p>

<p>It was not to be forever! One
thing remained, unasked and
unbeknownst, grooved with synaptic
permanence in their burgeoning
brains. <i>This was neither
beginning nor end: for though
Otah's Tribe was gone, bellies
still growled. Kurho's Tribe was
no more, but the weapons yet
remained.</i></p>

<p><i>There could be no beginning
or end&mdash;for would not new
things come, means and methods
and ways of devising so long as
man remained? Was not this
The Way?</i></p>

<p>Such were Mai-ak's thoughts
at the time of the next thaw;
when he felt the thing-that-prodded
that would not let him
be, and his anger became stubborn
resolve; when day after
day he bent the young saplings,
and found a way at last to fasten
the sinew.</p>

<p>When he pulled, finally, pulled
with all his strength, and with
great gloating saw his shaft go
outward to a distance never yet
conceived....</p>
